# FT_SHMUP
A "Rush" project from 42.
*The goal of this rush is to implement a simplistic shoot-em-up-style game in your terminal.*

### RUSH
A rush is a project where you are limited to a single 2-days weekend to complete a specific project. They are usually done on the final weekend of every month except for Jully, August and December. Rush projects are done in randomly assigned groups of 2 students (students do have to sign in to participate).

### LIMITATIONS
- This projected limits students to the C and C++ languages.
- It also limits the way the game is displayed.

## Display
As said above, this project limits how we display the game: you have to use ncurses.
Ncurses is a library made to display complexe user interfaces in the terminal, it basically allows you to place a character anywhere you'd like on the terminal but it is not made to make games with.
